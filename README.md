# Supervised-Learning-Classification-Comparison

This project compares the performance of various supervised learning methods for a binary classification problem. It aims to understand the strengths and weaknesses of different classification algorithms.

# Objectives of the project

Is to implement and compare the below mentioned supervised learning algorithms and assess the performance of each algorithm using metrics like precision, recall, accuracy, and F1-score.

Decision Tree
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)/Kernel SVM
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Naive Bayes
Logistic Regression.

# Steps performed

* Utilized libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn to implement the classification methods.

* Loaded the dataset from a .csv file and printed data information to understand its structure.

* Explored and Understood the Dataset and visualized the dataset using histograms and other plots.

* For each class, printed the statistical description of features, including mean, standard deviation, maximum, and minimum values.

**Data Preparation**

* Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) subsets. 

* Implemented and trained Classification Algorithms. Trained the model using the training dataset. 

* Used K-Fold Cross Validation (k=5) to tune hyperparameters. Evaluated using precision, recall, accuracy, and F1-Score to select the best model.

**Model Testing**

Tested the best model obtained from the tuning of each classification algorithm on the testing dataset. Plotted confusion matrices for each model. Reported performance using precision, recall, accuracy, and F1-Score, summarizing the results in tables and plots.
