# Supervised-Learning-Classification-Comparison

This project compares the performance of various supervised learning methods for a binary classification problem. It aims to understand the strengths and weaknesses of different classification algorithms.

# Objectives of the project

Is to implement and compare the below mentioned supervised learning algorithms and assess the performance of each algorithm using metrics like precision, recall, accuracy, and F1-score.

Decision Tree
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)/Kernel SVM
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Naive Bayes
Logistic Regression.

# Steps performed

* Utilized libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn to implement the classification methods.

* Loaded the dataset from a .csv file and printed data information to understand its structure.

* Explored and Understood the Dataset and visualized the dataset using histograms and other plots.

* For each class, printed the statistical description of features, including mean, standard deviation, maximum, and minimum values.

**Data Preparation**

* Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) subsets. 

* Implemented and trained Classification Algorithms. Trained the model using the training dataset. 

* Used K-Fold Cross Validation (k=5) to tune hyperparameters. Evaluated using precision, recall, accuracy, and F1-Score to select the best model.

**Model Testing**

Tested the best model obtained from the tuning of each classification algorithm on the testing dataset. Plotted confusion matrices for each model. Reported performance using precision, recall, accuracy, and F1-Score, summarizing the results in tables and plots.

# Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive comparison of different supervised learning algorithms applied to a binary classification problem. The detailed implementation and evaluation process help in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm, guiding the selection of the best model for specific datasets and tasks.
